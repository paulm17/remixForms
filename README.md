# remixForms

This is a fork of the remix-forms found here [0], in order for it to work with BlitzJS [1].

I am in no way affiliated with either project.  Just a fan of both and found that RHF and the current form implementation for Blitz was lacking in some areas.

When I came across RMF, I was so impressed that I immediately forked it.

With the newer versions, a lot of the code has been cleaned up so it's a lot more digestable.

No PRs please.  If you have any issues, find me on the Blitz discord [2] and tag me!
